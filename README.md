## Solana NFT Viewer

#### This React app was created to display all NFTs in any wallet on the Solana blockchain. Enter the address in the search bar and once the data is returned from the blockchain, the NFTs held in that wallet will be displayed. You can then 'favorite' any NFT which will reorder them and display the favorited NFTs first. Clicking on any NFT will take you to Solscan to display more info about that particular NFT.
##### Included is a button to generate a random Solana address in case you don't have access to a wallet address.
